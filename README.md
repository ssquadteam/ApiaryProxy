A Minecraft server proxy with unparalleled server support, scalability,
and flexibility.

ApiaryProxy is a fork of [Velocity-CTD](https://github.com/GemstoneGG/Velocity-CTD),
which is itself a fork of [PaperMC/Velocity](https://github.com/PaperMC/Velocity).
ApiaryProxy is licensed under the GPLv3 license, as required by its upstreams.

## Purpose

ApiaryProxy was created to replace poorly made plugins or
plugins that simply cannot be better as a result of API limitations,
lack of support/maintainability, infrequent bumping of integral
dependencies, useful performance improvements, and more.

## Goals

* A codebase that is easy to dive into and consistently follows best practices
  for Java projects as much as reasonably possible.
* High performance: handle thousands of players on one proxy.
* A new, refreshing API built from the ground up to be flexible and powerful
  whilst avoiding design mistakes and suboptimal designs from other proxies.
* First-class support for Paper, Sponge, Fabric and Forge. (Other implementations
  may work, but we make every endeavor to support these server implementations
  specifically.)
* Features that deliver an "all-in-one" experience with various features that
  we believe every network wants and needs.

## Additional Features/Removals

* Utilization of newer dependencies for virtually any dependency that can
  easily and fairly be upgraded to maintain the highest level of performance.
* Implementation of full-fledged Redis database support to fully replace
  plugins like RedisBungee in attempts to maintain a stabler Redis experience.
* Implementation of a highly dynamic and efficient queue system that is
  simplified in nature and intended to stably maintain thousands of players.
* Implementation of a non-invasive multi-forwarding system that allows you
  to use a different forwarding method for specific servers on the backend.
* Configurable `/alert` command sends messages across your entire network.
* Configurable `/alertraw` command to send non-prefixed messages across your
  entire network.
* Configurable `/find` command that locates yourself and other users.
* Configurable `/gkick` command that kicks a player from the network, supporting
  both local and cross-proxy (Redis) players.
* Configurable `/gip` command that retrieves the IP address of an online player,
  supporting both local and cross-proxy (Redis) players.
* `/hub` with `/lobby` alias that sends you to the/a fallback server,
  which synchronizes with the activation and deactivation of dynamic fallbacks.
* Configurable `/ping` command that displays your and other users' ping.
* Configurable `/plist` command that displays the total users on your proxy
  or from a defined proxy scope.
* The `/send` supports sending users from `{SERVER_FROM}` to `{SERVER_TO}`.
* Configurable `/transfer` command that allows you to move a player, "current" players,
  a specific server, or all players from one proxy to another.
* Configurable `/velocity sudo` command to force users to execute a command on the
  proxy or even server level.
* Configurable `/velocity uptime` command to view how long your proxy has been online for.
* Implementation of configurable `/server {SERVER}` access for tab completion and
  command execution.
* Choice implementation that allows you to fully strip, reload, and remove commands
  present in regular Velocity and require/force deactivation of commands for
  plugin overrides.
* Configurable value to disable translation for header and footer for Velocity to
  improve performance in plugins like TAB that do not need it.
* Configurable minimum version value that allows users to block users on versions
  older than your desired minimum server version (synchronizes with outdated pinger).
* Fallback servers allow users to be sent to the least or most populated server,
  which will cycle for even distribution.
* Configurable server brand and server pinger message (outdated and fallback).
* Configurable removal of unsigned message kick/disconnection events for plugins
  with improper compatibility.
* Configurable deactivation of Forge inbound handshakes for servers that do not
  run Forge or NeoForge as their server software.
* Other miscellaneous optimizations and tweaks that will only continue to be
  implemented as this fork matures.
* Preliminary MiniMessage support to permit full configurability of all Velocity
  messages, alongside `/velocity reload`able translations, alongside `/velocity reload`able
  server additions/removals inside the `velocity.toml`.
* Removal of all language files except `messages.properties` to preserve
  maintainability. PRs (Pull Requests) are welcome to reimplement all language files
  with our changes.
* And much, much more... Try it out and see what we have to offer for yourself!

## ApiaryProxy Permissions
* `velocity.command.alert` [/alert] (Allows you to display public alerts
  to all users on the proxy or proxies, depending on your setup).
* `velocity.command.alertraw` [/alertraw] (Allows you to display public non-formatted
  alerts to all users on the proxy or proxies, depending on your setup).

## ApiaryProxy Queue Commands
* `/server` [Default Aliases: `/queue` & `/joinqueue`]
* `/leavequeue` [Default Alias: `/dequeue`]

## Administrative Commands
* `/queueadmin add {PLAYER} {SERVER}`
* `/queueadmin addall {SERVER_FROM} {SERVER_TO}`
* `/queueadmin list`
* `/queueadmin listqueues`
* `/queueadmin pause {SERVER}`
* `/queueadmin remove {PLAYER} {SERVER}` (Not including server name
  removes the user from all queues if multiple queuing is enabled).
* `/queueadmin removeall {SERVER}`

## ApiaryProxy API

ApiaryProxy exposes its own api, one that is fully backwards-compatible with [com.velocitypowered:velocity-api](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.velocitypowered/velocity-api) with some additional features.
Some features are added to existing Velocity interfaces (in `com.velocitypowered.api`), and the CTD-custom functionality is exposed through the `com.velocityctd.api` package.

Our API mainly adds and exposes the redis and queue subsystem through the API module, allowing you to interact with this system through plugins.

See:
- `ProxyServer.getClusterPlayerService()`
- `ProxyServer.getClusterProxyService()`
- `ProxyServer.getQueueManager()`

ApiaryProxy does not publish its own Maven repository yet, so plugins compile against the
upstream [Velocity-CTD API artifacts](https://repo.velocityctd.com/#/), which are
binary-compatible with this fork:

**Maven**
```xml
<repository>
  <id>velocityctd-snapshots</id>
  <name>ApiaryProxy Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.velocityctd.com/snapshots</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.velocityctd</groupId>
  <artifactId>velocity-api</artifactId>
  <version>3.5.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**

_Groovy_
```groovy
maven {
    name "velocityctdSnapshots"
    url "https://repo.velocityctd.com/snapshots"
}

implementation "com.velocityctd:velocity-api:3.5.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

_Kotlin_
```kotlin
maven {
    name = "velocityctdSnapshots"
    url = uri("https://repo.velocityctd.com/snapshots")
}

implementation("com.velocityctd:velocity-api:3.5.0-SNAPSHOT")
```

## Special Notes
To proficiently review the stability and performance of your proxy in addition to spark,
consider utilizing JProfiler to enhance your experience and report any ongoing issues.

[![JProfiler](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4f6a94b-8da2-484a-85c8-537a4d19d188)](https://www.ej-technologies.com/jprofiler)

## Building

ApiaryProxy is built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org). We recommend using the
wrapper script (`./gradlew`) as our CI builds using it.

It is sufficient to run `./gradlew build` to run the full build cycle.

You can find new releases of ApiaryProxy in our [releases](https://github.com/GemstoneGG/ApiaryProxy/releases) tab,
where our latest updates will be compiled and ready for use.

## Running

Once you've built Velocity, you can copy and run the `-all` JAR from
`proxy/build/libs`. ApiaryProxy will generate a default configuration file,
and you can configure it from there.

## Localisation

Upstream Velocity's Translations are handled using [Crowdin](https://papermc-io.crowdin.com/velocity).
If you want to translate a language not available on Crowdin,
you might want to ask in the upstream's [Discord](https://discord.gg/papermc) about it.

ApiaryProxy removes the translations to preserve maintainability. See `Additional Features/Removals`.
